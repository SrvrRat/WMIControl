## Crutial
- [x] Database (built in options on that, but not anytime soon)

### Important
- [ ] Figure out CSV export
- [ ] WMI RPC control
- [ ] Make data in WMIscan match database data schema
- [X] Instead of skipping the computer already scanned, update it instead
- [ ] Find out what device and app_version does inside of AssetPanda

### Cleanup
- [ ] Config files to specify what you want done
- [x] Better CLI ARGs
- [x] Make AssetPanda support a configuration
- [x] Single settings for integrations (optional extra settings)
- [ ] Document extra settings
- [ ] Seperate code into files (WMI.py, scan.py, etc)
- [ ] Make imports abundantly clear what they're used for (via comments)
- [ ] MOAR comments

#### Wishlist
- [ ] Support for SnipeIT (waiting on RESTful API)
- [ ] NMAP control from program
- [ ] Support for many WMI authentication credentials
- [ ] HTTPS listener (encryption/auth)
- [ ] Make argument to skip already scanned computers rather than update it

##### Long Into The Future
- [ ] Some type of support for OSX/Linux
- [ ] GUI Interface
